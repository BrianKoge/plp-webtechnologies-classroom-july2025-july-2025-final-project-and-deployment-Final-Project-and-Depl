# üì¶ Final Assignment: Build, Organize, and Deploy a Multipage Website

You're now ready to bring everything together‚ÄîHTML, CSS, JavaScript, planning, structure, and deployment. This final project challenges you to **conceptualize, build, and deploy a multi-page website** that is responsive, interactive, and ready for the real world.

This assignment will guide you from planning your site all the way to deploying it online. Let‚Äôs make your project *production-worthy*! üöÄ

## üåêüéØ Part 1: Planning and Organizing a Multipage Website

Before you write any code, take time to plan:

* Define your website's purpose (portfolio, product showcase, blog, etc.)
* Outline 3‚Äì5 pages (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact, Gallery)
* Sketch or describe the layout of each page
* Map out internal navigation (how pages link to one another)

**Goal:** Show intentional structure and user journey across the site.

---

## üåçüíª Part 2: Build the Website Using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript

Using your plan, begin building:

* Use HTML5 for semantic structure
* Apply CSS for responsive layout, styling, and animations
* Use JavaScript to add interactivity (menus, forms, toggles, dynamic content)

Each page should:

* Be mobile-responsive
* Share a consistent layout/header/footer
* Include at least one interactive element (e.g., form validation, toggle menu, animation on scroll)

**Goal:** Integrate everything you‚Äôve learned in a cohesive, functioning project.

---

## üõ†Ô∏èüöÄ Part 3: Best Practices for Code Organization

Before deployment, refactor your project to follow production-friendly practices:

* Organize files in folders (`/css`, `/js`, `/images`, etc.)
* Write clean, modular, and commented code
* Use meaningful file names and relative paths
* Validate your HTML/CSS and test on different screen sizes

**Goal:** Prepare your codebase to be readable, maintainable, and scalable.

## üåêüöÄ Part 4: Introduction to Hosting and Deployment

Once your project is complete, choose a method to **host your site online**.

You can use:

* **GitHub Pages** (great for portfolios and static sites)
* **Netlify** (powerful CI/CD features and easy form support)
* **Vercel** (lightning-fast deployment for frontend projects)

Deploy your project and confirm that:

* All links and scripts work
* It loads properly on mobile and desktop
* It has a clear, shareable URL

**Goal:** Publish your work online and make it accessible to the world.

## üõ∞Ô∏è My Project Plan: Futuristic Space Tourism Website

**Purpose:** A simple, modern website with a futuristic vibe that showcases planets (blog-style entries) and includes a minimal booking form to request a tour/session.

**Working title:** "OrbitX ‚Äî Explore Beyond Earth"

### Pages (3‚Äì5 total)
* Home: Hero section with tagline, brief intro, CTA buttons (Explore Planets, Book).
* Planets (Blog-style): Grid/list of planet cards with image, short description, and a details view/modal.
* Book a Session: Simple form (name, email, preferred planet, date, notes) with basic validation and success message.
* About (optional): Short story of "humanity conquering space" and brand vision.
* Contact (optional): Social links and lightweight contact info.

### Layout & Navigation
* Shared header: logo/brand on the left, nav links on the right; responsive hamburger on mobile.
* Shared footer: copyright, quick links, social icons.
* Navigation map: Home ‚Üí Planets ‚Üí (optional) Planet Details Modal; Home ‚Üí Book a Session; Header links to all top-level pages.

### Visual Style
* Futuristic, minimal UI: dark background, neon accents, soft glows.
* Color palette: charcoal #0b0f16, accent cyan #00e5ff, magenta #ff2bd1, soft white #e6f1ff.
* Fonts: modern sans (e.g., Poppins/Inter) + monospace accent for small labels.
* Subtle animations: hover glows, fade-in on scroll, card tilt.
* Background: starfield gradient or animated stars (very light, non-distracting).

### Interactivity (JavaScript)
* Mobile menu toggle.
* Planet card interactions: expand/details modal with more info.
* Simple filter/search for planets (by type: terrestrial, gas giant, exotic).
* Form validation: required fields, email pattern, success toast.

### Content Plan
* 6‚Äì8 planets with image, short summary, category/type, travel note.
* Each entry: title, hero image, 60‚Äì100 word description, fun fact.

### Structure
```
project/
  index.html              (Home)
  planets.html            (Planets listing)
  book.html               (Booking form)
  about.html              (Optional)
  contact.html            (Optional)
  css/
    styles.css            (Global styles)
    planets.css           (Page-specific tweaks)
  js/
    main.js               (Nav/menu, shared scripts)
    planets.js            (Card interactions, filter)
    form.js               (Validation, success handling)
  images/
    planets/              (Planet images)
    ui/                   (Logos, icons, background)
```

### Accessibility & Responsiveness
* Semantic HTML5; alt text on images; focus-visible states.
* Mobile-first layout with CSS grid/flex responsive breakpoints.

### Deployment
* Option A: GitHub Pages (quick and simple).
* Option B: Netlify (nice for forms and previews).

### Minimal Timeline
1) Scaffold pages and folders
2) Style global theme and header/footer
3) Build Planets listing (cards + modal)
4) Implement booking form with validation
5) Test responsiveness and accessibility
6) Deploy and add live URL to this README

## Deliverables

1. A GitHub repository containing:

   * Your complete project code, properly organized
   * A `README.md` file explaining your project purpose, structure, and live URL
2. A live deployed website (hosted via GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)

---

## Outcome

* Clarity and thoroughness of planning documentation
* Proper use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript across multiple pages
* Responsive and accessible design
* Clean, well-organized, and commented code
* Successful live deployment with a working link
* Evidence of following best practices
